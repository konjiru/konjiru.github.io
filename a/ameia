            A Migrant's Experience in Australia
        </h1>
        <p id="para">
            “29.8% of Australia's population were born overseas” (ABS, 2021). Whether it be the attraction of being part
            of a multicultural society, study opportunities or healthcare, Emigrants are migrating to Australia in hopes
            of better living conditions (Austral, 2021). Though Australia promises better living-conditions, Australianisms
            – the Australian national character or spirit – tend to deviate from the light-hearted and forgiving Australian
            nature projected by the media, and a migrant’s experience may not be as expected. This contradiction is a
            common topic in multiple Australian media texts. An example of this, is the movie, <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i>,
            which “ultimately concerns a senior high school girl embracing her Italian heritage…”, the complexity of the
            film is derived from Josie Alibrandi – the protagonist of <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i> – trying to fit her family’s
            tradition into Australia’s extremely untraditional way of life (iMDb, 2021). A poem that portrays the
            paradoxical topic is <i>Migrants</i>, written by Margaret Scott, which follows Margaret Scott and her hatred
            towards Australia. Although both the poem, Migrant, and the movie, <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i>, portray a
            migrant’s experience in Australia as brutal and unforgiving, the poem shows an eternal hatred towards
            everything Australian whereas the main character of the movie eventually falls in love with Australia for
            all the opportunities it offers.

            Background Information
        </h2>
        <p id="para">
            <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i> opens with a statement about wogs being quite common in Australia. While meaning
            to be light-hearted, as at the time the movie was produced political correctness was not generally adhered
            to, there is a negative connotation to this description. Josie is the protagonist of the movie, and she narrates
            her experience throughout. Her experience is that of a 2nd generation migrant as her family has migrated
            from Italy and she was born in Australia. Conversely the poem, <i>Migrants</i>, begins with a very clear statement
            of, “How I hated this strange island”. Margaret Scott talks about the unfamiliarity of Australia. Margaret –
            the speaker – is a 1st generation migrant who has come from England. Her experience is vastly different
            from Josie’s as she was leaving behind a life, culture and identity while Josie, a teenager, was learning to
            understand how her Italian family fit within Australian society, and how her own identity, within her own
            family. The contrast between the poem, <i>Migrants</i>, and the movie, <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i>, is interesting as
            both portray the challenges, to the migrant’s experience. Margaret’s picture of a brutal and unforgiving land
            and her description of her belongings or perhaps herself. “The shielding leaves of memory were burnt away,
            and white defeat. Rose stripped of custom, friends and art” – referring to the loss in self-identity, similar to
            the brutality and unforgiving nature of Josie’s journey as a poorly-understood teenager; the personae are
            both seen as intruders and inferior in status.
        </p>
        <div class="parallax" style="background-image:url(&#39;ameia_src/splitter-2.png&#39;);" id="split-img"></div>
        <h2 id="head2">Pretenseful Discontent</h2>
        <p id="para">
            In both the chosen poem and film, the insensitive environment creates a realistic feeling of alienation and
            estrangement. In the poem, Margaret struggles with the brown grass, strange bird sounds and insects.
            Similarly, Josie is conflicted by the cultural difference between her loud and intrusive family in comparison
            to her friend’s families. These characters’ hardships originate from the disjoint within their own culture,
            threatening their way of life, causing stress and damage, prolonging the characters’ hardships. This self-sufficient 
            rabbit hole is portrayed in both the poem and the film. In <i>Migrants</i>, the writer states that, in the
            case of her and her husband, they are “Preoccupied with the private wreck” – sobering metaphor for their
            dissipating marriage – and “let transported love go dry”, which is a saddening extension of the said metaphor
            to evoke how estrangement slowly corrodes relationships. Strong metaphorical speech is used in these lines
            to depict that, while distracted - trying to fit into Australian society - Margaret and her husband let their own
            love wither, becoming so brittle that it quickly disintegrates when touched by adversity. Although Margaret
            writes that she and her husband let their love slip, the combination of epithet (“shady”) and metaphor
            (“hollows of pretence”) in the line, “The shady hollows of pretence”, implies that they are trying to uphold
            an image of successfully migrating to Australia, when, in fact, this migration drives a wedge between them
            and causes their love to disappear. This arrogant and criticising tone conveyed in the poem could be likened
            to that of a backseat driver - someone who is not in control but wants to dictate and criticize what is
            happening. Investigating deeper, Margaret and her husband migrated to Australia in the 1950s and
            published <i>Migrants</i> in the 1980s, allocating herself time to become Australian and then giving her readers
            an authentic picture of this endeavour. Her almost ‘backseat-driver’ attitude towards Australia in itself is an
            Australianism. Therefore, while Margaret might project an eternal hatred towards Australia, she’s actually
            warming up to this paradoxical land more than she realizes. This development is perfectly realistic, as grumpy
            people still exist on the shores of Australia, happy to remain discontented while still benefitting from
            Australia’s many wonderful opportunities.

        <h2 id="head2">Alienating Connotations</h2>
        <p id="para">
            Similarly, in the media text, Josie experiences a lack of belonging both to Australia and to her own Italian
            community: she is neither fully ‘true blue’, nor wog through and through. In the film, Josie struggles to
            cope with her final year of high school, including the racist attitudes of her peers, especially that of Carly –
            one of <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i>’s antagonists. An example of Carly’s abuse appears in the scene in-which, after
            portraying Carly as an exaggerated school celebrity – via slow-motion, close-up shots of her handing out
            autographs – the director employs a transition to depicting the latter’s conversation with her friends about
            the racial topics her dad “tackles” on television and states that “next he’s tackling, wogs on handouts”. Carly
            notices that Josie and Josie’s friends are listening to her conversation after an over-the-shouldershot reveals
            that Carly and Josie’s eyes meet. Carly then purposefully faces Josie while talking to her friends when she
            quotes her dad’s overtly racist comments as if proud of him and them, insinuating that Josie is an unwelcome
            wog who needs to be “tackled” or ‘handled’, thus incapable of earning a living without handouts. Looking
            for Alibrandi is praised for raising concerns about such racist connotations with one film critic making the
            following statement about this movie ‘with a touch of multiculturalism’: “The fact that the movie also deals
            with racism and other “isms” […] raised it up a notch for me” (IMDb, 2021). Adding to Josie’s school-struggles,
            Josie’s circumstance that she isn’t ‘wog through and through’ causes complications in her family. A scene
            which depicts such a situation happens after the iconic ‘Italian phone network scene’ when Josie arrives at
            her Nona, Katia’s house. Josie walks into the house uninvited as Katia ends a call and prepares to make a
            snack for Josie. Josie, before Katia says anything, dismisses her intention to make something for her –
            indicating a close bond which Josie pretends to rebel against. After being told she cannot use the airconditioner, Josie insults her Nona over a misinterpretation. After insulting Katia’s pronunciation, the
            protagonist is in danger of being struck by her Nona, but the latter refrains and tells her, “go home Josie, I
            do not want you here.” The beginning of this scene is filmed in one take by one camera using head level
            camera angles which feels like a family vs-tape, documenting a family gathering. Later in the scene, the 
            director uses more conventional multi-take sections which causes the perception of the attitude from being
            one of family ‘bliss’ to a more dysfunctional state of affairs, suiting Josie and Katia’s attitude towards each
            other. In the take described, close-up, over-the-shoulder shots emphasize the dialogue between Josie and
            her Nona, and music with a melancholy and sad tone fades in as Katia raises her hand to hit Josie signalling
            to the audience that Katia has had enough and doesn’t want to see Josie anymore – in the truly authentic
            Italian culture a youngster would not be disrespectful and rude to her elders and Katia’s rection emphasises
            thar Josie is not truly a wog, having adopted bad Western habits: “Italian parents generally have a lot of
            authority over their children throughout their lives. […] There is a deep respect for elderly family members
            in Italian culture” (Cultural Atlas, 2021). Josie’s rejection from both her peers and her family shows that, this
            young girl is both too Italian for Australians but also too Australian for Italians creating a sense of alienation
            and estrangement.

        <h2 id="head2">Bucket of Racists</h2>
        <p id="para">
            Margaret is a first-generation migrant whereas Josie is a second-generation one. Margaret continues to
            expose the reader to her hatred through the poem whereas Josie seems to adapt to Australia without
            betraying her roots. In the poem, the first line, “How I hated this strange island”, defines the topic of the
            poem as her rejection of Australia through the use of the jarring epithet: “strange island” – creating a clear
            detachment from what’s supposed to be her new home. The poet utilizes strong hyperbolic and metaphoric
            language to emphasize her animosity in almost every line of the poem. Examples of such are the lines “We
            shrivelled up to mechanic insects / Battling with gritty minutiae.” By using strong metaphors such as
            “shrivelled” and “insects” and the rather cold descriptor “mechanic”, Margaret is describing how, 
            postmigration, she and her family’s identity diminished to nothing more than automated and replaceable
            creatures whose purpose and destiny fade into complete insignificance. One can see it everywhere: 
            firstgeneration migrants are looked down upon, forcing migrants to either comply with the pea sized
            expectations or go through thick and thin to prove themselves to the majority. In the poem, Margaret
            complies with the expectations set by the majority, and despises her experience ‘down-under’. Contrary to
            this, Josie progresses from rebelling against Australia to accepting Australia for its wonderful opportunities.
            In a previously analysed scene, Josie’s friend, Sera sums up Josie’s attitude towards Australia, “f*cking
            racists!” which is validated by Josie shortly afterwards when she reacts “ugh, give me a bucket…”, statement
            made after Carly’s remark about tackling wogs. The first scene in-which Josie seems to be enjoying Australia’s
            opportunities is the one when Jacob, Josie’s prom date, gives her a ride home on his motorbike. The scene
            transitions from Josie being suspicious about the bike to Josie screaming with joy into Jacob’s ear as he
            switches lanes narrowly missing traffic; the director uses upbeat romantic 2000s rock music in combination
            with close-up shots of Josie’s ecstatic facial expressions to show enjoyment of rebelling against her family’s
            shackles. This contrasts with her previous attitude she projected towards family and friends, creating a
            epiphany in-which Josie realises some of Australia’s opportunities and freedoms. Josie sub-consciously falls
            in love with Jacob during this scene, giving herself a reason to allow Australia to prove itself. A scene which
            really confirms this aspect is the outro to the movie, another tomato day narrated by Josie who explains,
            “I’ve always dreamt of being someone impressive and famous. Ya’ know, someone people can sit back and
            envy. […] But I know now that what’s important is who I feel I am”, showing growth in Josie’s attitude. The
            director then further displays her newly developed confidence and deeper understanding of her identity as
            a mix of Italian culture and an Australian one, with respect towards her family’s traditions as well as the ‘land
            down under’ which is now her new home. This is demonstrated by Josie dancing along to the music with her 
            ‘true-blue’ boyfriend, Jacob, music which she initially rejected at the beginning of the movie. Proving the
            successful attempt at finding herself and her identity, moving the audience, a critic reviewer wrote: “[…] we
            see her accepting her culture with a better understanding of who she is - a strong Alibrandi woman. (Cue:
            happy tears).” (Hing, 2020)

        <p id="para">
            Both <i>Looking for Alibrandi</i> and Migrant depict a migrant’s experience as challenging and complex. While the
            film focuses on how Josie manages to fit both her Italian culture as well as Australia’s unconventional culture
            into her family. The poem projects an absolute rejection of Australia, but it also offers an indication that,
            internally, the author is warming up to Australia more than she realises. Ultimately, the texts are trying to
            tell their audience that, although migration is difficult, complex and it probably won’t go completely to plan,
            there is hope and the opportunities and freedom in Australia – ‘she’ is completely worth it: “Crocodiles are
            easy. They try to eat and kill you. People are harder. Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first.” – Steve
            Irwin
